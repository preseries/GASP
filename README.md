# Generally Accepted Startup Principles (GASP)

Because there is no standard industry practice in venture capital to assess startups, we took it on ourselves to design a framework that can be used and re-used freely by anyone anywhere. The objective of this framework is to offer a common set of variables that can be derived to easily perform feature engineering tasks for machine learning. In other words, by standardizing the collection of startup data we empower investors to put that data to use, uncover insights, and not let it sit on a dusty spreadsheet, never to be looked at again. We named our framework the GASP (Generally Accepted Startup Principles), a very obvious pun on the mother of accounting standards, the GAAP.

The GASP in its most complete form is currently represented in a 10 tab spreadsheet. Each variable is approached from a historical perspective, meaning we’re interested in the evolution of each variable over time. A detailed explanation of each variable is available in the documentation folder of the GASP GitHub repository. We open sourced the framework because we believe it’s only through collaboration and transparency that we can transform venture capital from its current subjective practice to a highly analytical one.


## Prerequisites

The framework is presented as a Microsoft Excel file (.xls). Several other software applications are capable of working with this type of file (Google Sheet, Open Office, etc.). However we recommend editing the document with a recent version of Microsoft Excel to avoid any compatibility issue.

## Usage

This framework is made to facilitate data collection of startup information. One GASP spreadsheet equals one startup. Simply fill the empty cells with the correct values. Do not forget to change the dates in the top rows to timestamp the data collected. Values need to be entered on a monthly basis.

## Contributing

There are two ways you can contribute to this project:

- Send us suggestions or edits to [gasp@preseries.com](mailto:gasp@preseries.com). It is the easiest way to contribute to the project. If your changes or ideas are accepted, your name will appear in the Authors section as “contributor”, along with a link to the social media account of your choice.

- Through GitHub. It is the fastest way to contribute but you need to be familiar with GitHub:

	1. Fork the repository. Then you will have a copy of our GASP repository in your own account.
	2. You can clone the repo in your local system and start working with the file making changes, pushing changes into your forked repo, etc.
	3. If you want to share with us your changes in order to us modify the GASP standard, you need to perform a Pull Request

	If you are new to GitHub, here is short illustrated guide on how to perform the steps mentioned above: [https://guides.github.com/activities/forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking)
